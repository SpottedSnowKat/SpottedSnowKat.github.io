			<p>
				This demonstrates the effects on an observer's perception of the cars of relativistic speeds. 
				If the cars were to travel at speeds close to that of the speed of light, length contraction 
				would result in the cars appearing to have different lengths to if they were at rest.
				This could potentially alter the relative observed lengths of the cars enough that the shorter
				car were never fully obscured. <br>
				The animation runs three times, each with the blue car travelling at a different speed. The speeds are written at the bottom-left;
				v1 is the speed of the red car, and v2 that of the blue. The rest length of the blue car remains constant between animations (as does that of the red);
				the only difference is the length contraction caused by the speed relative to an observer. 
				<br> Unlike in other animations, this animation shows the linear, rather than rotational, speeds of the cars.
